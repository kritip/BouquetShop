BouquetShop
===========
The project consists of a model bouquetshop.

Features

-> At any point of time during navigation, 'Home' and 'New' are clickable

-> The home page shows the current bouquets available in the model

-> While taking new input for a bouquet design, the project assumes the bouquet can go without a name, arrangement style, occasion, price or whether valid for home delivery or not. However, throws an error if no flowers are selected (Intuitive, there can be no bouquet design without choice of flowers)

-> The delete function confirms whether a selected option has to be deleted or not.
